Following the 2010 decennial Census of Population, the Nebraska legislative districts will be
redrawn to accommodate changes in population. Similar to the 2000 redistricting,
Nebraska’s forty-nine (49) legislative districts which are drawn on the principle of ‘one
person one vote’ will need adjustment for an increase in overall population and its continued
shift eastward. In addition to the legal mandates of equal population are compact districts
that are contiguous in nature. Augmenting these legal parameters is the preservation of
communities of interest (COIs) -neighborhoods with shared economic or cultural
characteristics. These include such things as school districts, counties, cities, natural resource
districts (NRD), and economic trade areas. Balancing all of these criteria can be daunting. With the advent of GIS software and the personal computer, literally thousands of iterations
can be performed in the time it used to take to draw one plan by hand. The objective of this
study is to use spatial analysis methods to determine the starting points for drawing districts
that meet the redistricting criteria. ArcInfo’s location allocation (LA) is utilized in
conjunction with GeoLytics population estimates at the block-group level for 2011 along
with the geographic boundaries for the COIs to delineate boundaries for the unicameral. It is
hoped that this project will serve as a tool for policy makers charged with carrying out the
redistricting process. Keyword: GIS, Nebraska unicameral, redistricting
